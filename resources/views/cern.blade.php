                        The bar for the Trump administration has been set so low in the past two months that actual scientists have recieved funding for a new study. The international science community has been watching the administration slowly lower the bar; now, some high-energy physicists are looking into a potential collapse into singularity as the bar rapidly approaches zero.

                        The study is being funded by several civil rights groups and countries. Most notable on the list is Canada as the Trudeau administration looks to further humiliate Trump at every opportunity -- somtimes more than twice a day. When asked for a comment, Trudeau's spokesperson has been unreachable except for an email response of the following photograph:
